Net tl/datapath_inst/instruction_register/r_we_cr_reg_rep__5_59 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin tl/datapath_inst/instruction_register/r_reg_reg[0][28]_LDC_i_1/O, cell tl/datapath_inst/instruction_register/r_reg_reg[0][28]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
